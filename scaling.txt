We could integrate the chatbot into our own simple web app. If we deployed a Flask web app to Heroku, for example, 
we could add in a Flask route that sends user input to the chatbot and then returns the output from the chatbot. Of course,
this assumes that the chatbot can be imported and called into the Flask app. A similar process could be used to integrate 
the chat bot into any web app (Django, Node.js, etc.) on any deployment service (AWS, GCP, etc.), although it would 
probably require more steps. The process for deploying a chatbot to a Flask app on Heroku is detailed in this Medium 
article: https://medium.com/@kumaramanjha2901/building-a-chatbot-in-python-using-chatterbot-and-deploying-it-on-web-7a66871e1d9b. 
The chatbot would also require a front-end UI with HTML/CSS so that users can directly interact with it. Simple UI 
designs could be found with a quick Google search and possibly in the documentation for the Bootstrap framework.
